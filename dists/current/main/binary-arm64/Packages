Description: PPtP/L2TP/PPPoE/SSTP server for Linux
 Overview
 --------
 The ACCEL-PPP v1.0 is completly new implementation of PPTP/PPPoE/L2TP/SSTP which was written from scratch.
 Userspace daemon has its own PPP implementation, so it does not uses pppd and one process (multi-threaded) manages all connections.
 ACCEL-PPP uses kernel-mode implementations of pptp/l2tp/pppoe and user-mode of sstp.
 .
 .

 10. Extensible logging engine with per session logging support, implemented log to file, log to remote host and log to PostgreSQL targets
 11. Extensible user/password database, implemented Radius, pppd compatible chap-secrets sources
 12. Extensible IP pool, implemented Radius, chap-secrets and static pools
 13. Supported pppd compatible ip-up/ip-down scripts
 14. Builtin tbf/htb shaper manager
 15. Command line interface via telnet
 16. SNMP support (master or subagent via AgentX)

 .
 .
 Requirment
 ----------
 1. modern linux distribution
 2. kernel-2.6.25 or later
 4. cmake-2.6 or later
 5. libnl-2.0 or probably later (required for builtin shaper)
 6. libcrypto-0.9.8 or probably later (openssl-0.9.8)
 7. libpcre
 8. net-snmp-5.x 
 9. libssl-0.9.8 or probably later (openssl-0.9.8)
 .
 .
 Compilation and instalation
 -----------
 Make sure you have configured kernel headers in /usr/src/linux,
 or specify other location via KDIR.
 1. cd /path/to/accel-ppp-1.3.5
 2. mkdir build
 3. cd build
 4. cmake [-DBUILD_DRIVER=FALSE] [-DKDIR=/usr/src/linux] [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local] [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release] [-DLOG_PGSQL=FALSE] [-DSHAPER=FALSE] [-DRADIUS=TRUE] [-DNETSNMP=FALSE] ..
    Please note that the double dot record in the end of the command is essential. You&apos;ll probably get error or misconfigured sources if you miss it.
    BUILD_DRIVER, KDIR, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, LOG_PGSQL, SHAPER, RADIUS  are optional,
    But while pptp is not present in mainline kernel you probably need BUILD_DRIVER.
    For example:
    cmake -DBUILD_DRIVER=TRUE ..
    will configure sources to build pptp driver, search kernel headers at /usr/src/linux, install to /usr/local,
    build with no debug, pgsql and shaper support, build with radius support.
 5. If you want to use chap-secrets for authentication purpose then you need to disable radius support, configure as following:
    cmake -DBUILD_DRIVER=TRUE -DRADIUS=FALSE ..
    of course you can include additional options if needed.
 6. make
 7. make install
 .
 .
 Configuration
 -------------
 read man accel-ppp.conf
 .
 .
 Built-in shaper
 --------------
 accel-ppp supports tbf and htb based shaper manager.
 To enable it uncomment shaper in [modules] section.
 It accepts radius attributes in various formats: rate, down-rate/up-rate and cisco-like. Values have to be in kilobits except cisco-like.
 For example:
 Filter-Id=1000 (means 1000Kbit both up-stream and down-stream rate)
 Filter-Id=2000/3000 (means 2000Kbit down-stream rate and 3000Kbit up-stream rate)
 To change radius attribute which containes rate information use &apos;attr&apos; option, for example:
 [shaper]
 attr=My-Custom-Rate-Attribute
 of course this attribute have to be in radius dictionary.
 To specify different attributes for down-stream and up-stream rates use &apos;attr-down&apos; and &apos;attr-up&apos; options, for example:
 [shaper]
 attr-down=PPPD-Downstream-Speed
 attr-up=PPPD-Upstream-Speed
 .
 If you want to use cisco-like format configure accel-ppp as following:
 [shaper]
 vendor=Cisco
 attr=Cisco-AVPair
 and send two attributes:
 Cisco-AVPair=lcp:interface-config#1=rate-limit input 2000000 8000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop (which means 2000Kbit up-stream rate and 8Kb burst)
 Cisco-AVPair=lcp:interface-config#1=rate-limit output 2000000 8000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop (which means 2000Kbit down-stream rate and 8Kb burst)
 .
 .
 Advanced shaper using
 ---------------------
 1. Burst configuration.
 If you not using cisco-like format then burst calculates from rate and specified burst factors.
 To specify burst factors use &apos;down-burst-factor&apos; and &apos;up-burst-factor&apos; options, for example:
 [shaper]
 down-burst-factor=1.0
 up-burst-factor=10.0
 which means that burst for tbf/htb qdisc will be calculated as down-stream rate multiply to 1.0 and burst for policer/htb will be calculated as up-stream rate multiply to 10.0.
 .
 2. Time ranges.
 You can specify time ranges to authomatic rate reconfiguration.
 To specify time ranges use following sample configuration:
 [shaper]
 time-range=1,1:00-3:00
 time-range=2,3:00-5:00
 time-range=3,5:00-7:00
 first number is time range identifier.
 To specify time range specific rates use following format of radius attributes: range-id,rate, range-id,down-rate/up-rate or cisco-like, for example:
 Filter-Id=1000
 Filter-Id=1,2000
 Filter-Id=2,3000
 Filter-Id=3,4000
 which means: set 1000Kbit by default, set 2000Kbit in time range 1, set 3000Kbit in time range 2, set 4000Kbit in time range 3.
 You have to pass multiple Filter-Id attributes to utilize this functionality.
 Or cisco-like:
 Cisco-AVPair=lcp:interface-config#1=rate-limit output access-group 1 1000000 8000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop
 Cisco-AVPair=lcp:interface-config#1=rate-limit input access-group 1 1000000 8000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop
 and so on...
 .
 3. chap-secrets.
 If you use chap-secrets instead of radius then there is way to utilize built-in shaper too.
 The optional fifth column in chap-secrets file is used to pass rate information to shaper.
 Its format is same as for radius attributes, except you cann&apos;t utilize time ranges functionality.
 .
 .
 SNMP
 ----
 SNMP is implemented using net-snmp libraries. By default accel-ppp starts in subagent mode,
 so make sure that net-snmp configured with subagent control turned on (read net-snmp&apos;s README.agentx for more details).
 Also you can start accel-ppp as master agent using following configuration:
 [snmp]
 master=1
 .
 Usage:
 Place accel-pppd/extra/net-snmp/ACCEL-PPP-MIB.txt to your mibs directory.
 Also you can find used numerical oids in this file.
 1. Requesting statistics:
 snmpwalk -m +ACCEL-PPP-MIB -v 2c -c local 127.0.0.1 ACCEL-PPP-MIB::accelPPPStat
 2. Requesting sessions:
 snmptable -m +ACCEL-PPP-MIB -v 2c -c local 127.0.0.1 ACCEL-PPP-MIB::sessionsTable
 3. Terminate session by session identifier (Acct-Session-ID):
 snmpset -m +ACCEL-PPP-MIB -v 2c -c local 127.0.0.1 ACCEL-PPP-MIB::termBySID.0 = 0000000000000001
 4. Terminate session by interface name:
 snmpset -m +ACCEL-PPP-MIB -v 2c -c local 127.0.0.1 ACCEL-PPP-MIB::termByIfName.0 = ppp2
 5. Terminaten session by IP address (Framed-IP-Address):
 snmpset -m +ACCEL-PPP-MIB -v 2c -c local 127.0.0.1 ACCEL-PPP-MIB::termByIP.0 = 192.168.10.10
 6. Terminate session by username:
 snmpset -m +ACCEL-PPP-MIB -v 2c -c local 127.0.0.1 ACCEL-PPP-MIB::termByUsername.0 = user1
 7. Execute cli command:
 snmpset -m +ACCEL-PPP-MIB -v 2c -c local 127.0.0.1 ACCEL-PPP-MIB::cli.0 = &quot;shaper change all 1024 temp&quot;
 .
 .
 chap-secrets encryption
 -----------------------
 To enable chap-secrets encryption ablity accel-ppp must be compiled with -DCRYPTO=OPENSSL (which is default).
 Username field may be kept as cleartext or hashed through some hash chain. To specify hash chain use username-hash option.
 For example, username-hash=md5,sha1 means hash username through md5 and then binary result hash through sha1.
 Username have to be specified as hexadecimal dump of digest result.
 Password field have to be encrypted using smbencrypt (NT Hash part).
 Encryption is incompatible with auth_chap_md5 module.
 .
 .
 Warning !!!
 -----------
 1. The pptp driver conflicts with ip_gre driver (in kernel), so make sure that ip_gre is not built-in or loaded at run time
    (don&apos;t matter if you have 2.6.37 or later kernel).
 2. Don&apos;t mix connections of accel-ppp and poptop&apos;s pptpd, before starting accel-ppp make sure that no connections
    of pptpd exists.

 EIGRP, RIP, RIPng, LDP, BFD, PIM, VRRP, PBR, and NHRP.
 .
 These protocols are used to turn your system into a dynamic router,
 exchanging information about available connections with other routers
 in a standards-compliant way.  The actual packet forwarding
 functionality is provided by the OS kernel.
 .
 FRRouting is a fork of Quagga with an open community model. The main
 git lives on https://github.com/frrouting/frr.git and the project name
 is commonly abbreviated as "FRR."

Description: access point and authentication server for Wi-Fi and Ethernet
 IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/WPA3/EAP Authenticator
 .
 Originally, hostapd was an optional user space component for Host AP
 driver. It adds more features to the basic IEEE 802.11 management
 included in the kernel driver: using external RADIUS authentication
 server for MAC address based access control, IEEE 802.1X Authenticator
 and dynamic WEP keying, RADIUS accounting, WPA/WPA2/WPA3 (IEEE 802.11i/RSN)
 Authenticator and dynamic TKIP/CCMP keying.
 .
 The current version includes support for other drivers, an integrated
 EAP authenticator (i.e., allow full authentication without requiring
 an external RADIUS authentication server), and RADIUS authentication
 server for EAP authentication.
 .
 hostapd works with the following drivers:
 .
  * mac80211 based drivers with support for master mode [linux]
  * Host AP driver for Prism2/2.5/3 [linux]
  * Driver interface for FreeBSD net80211 layer [kfreebsd]
  * Any wired Ethernet driver for wired IEEE 802.1X authentication.

Description: DHCP client for automatically obtaining an IP address
 This is the Internet Software Consortium's DHCP client.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
 .
 Extra documentation can be found in the package isc-dhcp-common.
 .
 ISC has decided to stop maintaining the client and relay parts of isc-dhcp,
 and they will be removed after the 4.4.3 release, keeping only the server
 component. Please, consider using an alternative for isc-dhcp-client
 (dhclient).

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: Program to control packet filtering rules by Netfilter project
 This software provides an in-kernel packet classification framework that is
 based on a network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and the nft userspace
 command line tool. The nftables framework reuses the existing Netfilter
 subsystems such as the existing hook infrastructure, the connection tracking
 system, NAT, userspace queueing and logging subsystem.
 .
 nftables replaces the old popular iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables.
 .
 Netfilter software and nftables in particular are used in applications such
 as Internet connection sharing, firewalls, IP accounting, transparent
 proxying, advanced routing and traffic control.
 .
 A Linux kernel >= 3.13 is required. However, >= 4.14 is recommended.

Description: UDP Broadcast Packet Relay
 This program listens for packets on a specified UDP broadcast port. When
 a packet is received, it sends that packet to all specified interfaces
 but the one it came from as though it originated from the original
 sender.
 .
 The primary purpose of this is to allow games on machines on separated
 local networks (Ethernet, WLAN) that use udp broadcasts to find each
 other to do so.
 .
 It also works on ppp links, so you can log in from windows boxes (e.g.
 using pptp) and play LAN-based games together. Currently, you have to
 care about upcoming or downgoing interfaces yourself.
